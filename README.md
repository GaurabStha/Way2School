# Way2School

Way2School is a data-driven school transport planning tool developed for GovHack ACT 2025.  
It leverages government open datasets and graph analytics to make school journeys faster, safer, and more flexible for families.

ðŸš¸ Key Features:
- Predicts Park & Ride availability and risk before departure.
- Provides multiple multimodal routes (drive, bus, light rail, walk, bike) with ETA, fare, and safety score.
- Identifies schools and stations lacking Park & Ride within 600m, suggesting alternatives within 2km.
- Uses OpenStreetMap pedestrian networks to generate real walking paths for the last mile.
- Simulates live trip tracking with notifications for parents.
- Helps planners identify where new Park & Ride or alternative parking sites will have the most impact.

ðŸ“Š Data Sources:
- ACT School Bus Services  
- Park & Ride Locations  
- Census Data for ACT Schools  
- Students by SA1  
- Bus Routes (MULTILINESTRING)  
- OpenStreetMap pedestrian networks  

ðŸŒ± Impact:
Way2School diverts cars from school gates during peak windows, improves child safety on the last mile, and equips planners with evidence for smarter infrastructure investment.
